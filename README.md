🚀 Number Guessing Game in Java 🚀

I recently worked on a fun project – a Number Guessing Game written in Java. 🎮

🔍 Key Highlights of the Code:

-> Scanner and Random Classes:

       - We use the Scanner class to take input from the user.

       - The Random class is used to generate a random number that the user must guess.

-> Game Rules:

       - The game generates a random number between 1 and 100.

       - The player has 5 attempts to guess the correct number.

       - After each guess, the program provides feedback if the guess is too high, too low, or correct.

-> Game Logic:

       - The program starts by printing instructions and the number of attempts.

       - Using a while loop, the player is prompted to enter their guess. The loop continues until the player runs out of attempts or guesses the number.

       - If the guess is correct, the game announces the win. If not, it informs the player whether their guess was "Too high" or "Too low".

       - If the player runs out of attempts, the game reveals the correct number.

-> Key Conditions:

       - If the user enters a number outside the defined range (1-100), the game prompts them to enter a valid number.

       - The game also keeps track of remaining attempts and provides immediate feedback after each guess.

       - This project helped reinforce my understanding of control flow in Java and how to utilize classes like Scanner and Random to create interactive programs. 🧑‍💻
